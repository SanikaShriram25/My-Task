 Computer Basics – Detailed Notes

1. Introduction of Computer

A computer is an electronic device.

It accepts data (input), processes it using instructions, stores it if required, and provides the final result (output).

Computers are very fast, accurate, and can handle a large amount of data.

They work only with the help of hardware and software.


2. Basic Definition of Computer

A computer can be defined as:

Computer = Input + Processing + Output + Storage

Example:

You type numbers (input) → computer calculates (processing) → shows the result on the screen (output) → you can save it in a file (storage).


3. Main Functions of a Computer

1. Input Function → Receiving data and instructions from input devices like keyboard, mouse, scanner, etc.


2. Processing Function → The CPU (Central Processing Unit) processes the data with the help of instructions (software).


3. Output Function → After processing, the result is displayed through output devices like monitor, printer, or speaker.


4. Storage Function → Data and results can be stored permanently or temporarily for future use.


4. Parts of Computer Functions

4.1 Hardware

The physical components of the computer which we can touch.

Examples: CPU, monitor, keyboard, mouse, printer, hard disk.


4.2 Software

The set of programs and instructions which tell the computer how to work.

Software cannot be touched, only seen or used.

Examples: Operating System (Windows, Linux), Application Software (MS Word, Excel, browsers).


4.3 Difference between Hardware and Software

  Hardware	                             Software

Physical parts of computer	        Programs and instructions
Can be touched	Cannot be touched
Without software, hardware is useless	Without hardware, software cannot work
Examples: Keyboard, monitor, CPU	Examples: MS Word, Windows, Photoshop


5. Input and Output Devices

5.1 Input Devices

Devices used to give data and instructions to the computer.

Examples:

Keyboard → for typing

Mouse → for pointing and clicking

Scanner → for scanning documents

Microphone → for voice input



5.2 Output Devices

Devices used to show results after processing.

Examples:

Monitor → displays text, images, videos

Printer → prints documents

Speakers → give sound output



5.3 Difference between Input and Output Devices

Input Devices	                         Output Devices

Used to send data into the computer	Used to give result out of the computer
Examples: Keyboard, mouse, scanner	Examples: Monitor, printer, speaker


6. Memory in Computer

6.1 Primary Memory (Main Memory)

Directly accessed by the CPU.

Very fast but limited in size.

Two main types:

RAM (Random Access Memory) → Temporary memory, data is lost when power is off.

ROM (Read Only Memory) → Permanent memory, stores important instructions for starting the computer.



6.2 Secondary Memory (Storage)

Used for long-term storage of data.

Larger in size but slower than primary memory.

Examples: Hard disk, SSD, Pen drive, CD/DVD.


6.3 Difference between Primary and Secondary Memory

Primary Memory	Secondary Memory

Fast and directly used by CPU	Slower and used for permanent storage
Small in size	Large in size
Examples: RAM, ROM	Examples: Hard disk, SSD, CD
