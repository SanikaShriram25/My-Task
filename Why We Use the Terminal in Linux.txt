# Why We Use the Terminal in Linux

The terminal in Linux is used because it gives a simple and powerful way to interact with the system.

- It is faster and more efficient than using menus.  
- Gives more control over the system.  
- Helps automate tasks using shell scripts.  
- Uses very little system resources (lightweight).  
- Allows remote access to other machines with ssh.  
- Commands can be combined for flexible use.  
- Useful for learning and solving problems since most guides use commands.
